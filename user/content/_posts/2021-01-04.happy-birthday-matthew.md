Today, is Matthew’s 4th birthday and I wanted to take a minute to celebrate that here on my blog and with all emotions going on in the world, and hopefully, this will brighten your day.

I want to wish my little guy a Happy Birthday of all times. Little did I know that 4 years ago when he was born that this little dude is going to be a handful, waking up at night wiping his butt, peeing on us when changing his diaper. Watching him taking his first step and saying his first word, tho I don’t remember what that is cause I probably missed it.

As he grew up in the last 4 years, he begins to learn new things, new words that no one had taught him, even some inappropriate words that somehow he knows but in the end, he has been quite an interesting kid
